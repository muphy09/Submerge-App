Confusion -
- There is a $1250 kicker always present in retail cost (E309)
- Spa Prep ($250) never included in COST-NEW (INTD25)?
- 'Columns' only bill when a facing is selected; otherwise ignored (stone/rockwork)
    - Custom facing option?
- Remodel workflow
    - Cant find tabs in excel?

Question - 
- Should things like Cleaner & Autofil run be inputs when entered on equip? Or stay in plumb
- Should Water Features (costs) be grouped into Equip cost breakdown (like excel) or separate like the app now
- What other information can be included in the large Tile in proposal summary?
- What stages a Proposal can be in;
        - Currently; Draft, Submitted, *deleted*.
        - Possibly; In Progress, Saved for Later, Archived, Submitted, Approved, Completed.
- Proposal version needs to be included in the different breakdowns?
- Costs / Equipment that is 'included' by default?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, there is a Contract Preview option in the Proposal Summary screen that opens the NC Gunite Contract and prefills existing data from the proposal into the appropriate boxes on the Contract. I have 3 more contracts that I would like to include as an option to select for the proposal data to be filled into that particular contract, instead of the contract that is currently there. They are laid out very similar to the original contract, but will include different wording. These new contracts are located in /docs/Contracts as '2024 Contract NC Fiberglass.pdf' '2024 Contract SC Gunite.pdf' and '2024 Contract SC Fiberglass.pdf', the original contract used to be named '2024 Contract NC Gunite' but has been renamed to 'PPAS Contract Template', just so we're on the same page. What I would like you to do is implement these 3 contracts the same way the original contract was implemented - Values from the proposal should populate in the same areas they do in the original. Input field background colors need to be the same as the original contract template, with green for the autofilled information, blue for and input that can be entered/changed, and yellow for the inital / signature fields. Exporting the contract should provide a clean output with the new values, just like the original does. After all 3 of the contracts are properly mapped into the app just like the original - we are going to add some logic for the way a contract is selected to ensure the proper one is always displayed. We need to include a new input box in the Pool Specifications category in the Customer Information subcategory. There will be the input box for customer name, customer city, and now Customer State - which will be a dropdown with the options NC and SC (NC will be default). If the selected state is NC, and in the Pool Dimensions the 'Gunite (Custom)' option is selected - then only the 2024 NC Gunite contract should be displayed when clicking on the Contract block in the summary. If the selected state is NC, and in the pool dimensions the 'Fiberglass' option is selected - only display the 2024 NC Fiberglass contract when the block is clicked. Same for when SC and Gunite are selected - show 2024 SC Gunite contract, and if SC and Fiberglass are selected show the 2024 SC Fiberglass contract. Take your time and ensure a proper implementation for this to work as intended.

 A couple changes to make in the Proposal Summary screen. 1st, the large summary tile information needs to change. The 2x4 table instead needs to have (column 1) 'Customer Name:', 'Job Location:'(this is the city), 'Build Type:' (this will only be 'New Pool' for all proposals for now), 'Last Modified:' (this will be the date of the last modification OF THAT VERSION, other versions might have a different date). Column 2 - 'Price Model:' (displays the price model pill box, instead of in the top right), ' We need to get rid of the 'Pre 1% COGS Breakdown' tile. Next, add the export checkbox to the Contract tile just like it is for the other tiles.
