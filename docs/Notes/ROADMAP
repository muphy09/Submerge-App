---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Term - 
- Temp disable View Changelog button
- Remove the cents from the admin panel proposal view and designer proposal view
- Custom Tile, Coping, Decking with inputs for total cost - replaces pre selected option in costs
Were going to include a new option in the dropdown menus of the Tle Level, Coping Type, and Decking Type dropdowns inside of the Tile / Coping / Decking category. Include an option for "No Tile" in the Tile Level, "No Coping" in the Coping Type, and "No Decking" in the Decking Type. Selecting one of these options will remove the costs associated with selecting a level of tile, coping, and decking. Essentially letting the pool designer skip that portion if it is not needed for this build. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mid Term - 
- $$ Logo upload option for admin, makes available for franchise
Inside of the Settings panel if an Admin / Owner is signed in, a new setting allowing the upload/input of a Global Logo to be used by the Franchise the Admin is apart of. If an Admin inputs a logo into this new area, the default Submerge logo that is used throughout the App will be replaced by the logo that the Admin provides for their franchise. Be thorough and detailed when determining where this logo swap will occur, it should be everywhere inside of the App that would normally have the Submerge logo or need a logo. This new logo will reflect for all of the designers /adminds in that particular franchise as well. 
- Login passwords and role promotion / pass reset
    I want you to review the file i have made at /docs/Notes/Login Overhaul and before making any changes ensure you understand what needs to be done or ask any questions you may have. If I have left out anything that you think should be added bring that up too. Then i will tell you to implement this change
- Homescreen UI update for designers
We need to make some changes with the way a designer sees the Homescreen. Remove the Performance Overview entirly, and leave just the Recent Proposals and Quick Actions blocks. Next, in the Proposals tab, remove the Total Cogs, Gross Profit %, and Gross Profit Amount columns from view. Add a new column named "Proposal Versions" listing how many versions the proposal has. This column should be listed after the Pricing Model column. Then, add another new column named "Contract Type" and list the type of contract that the proposal applies to - NC Guntie, NC Fiberglass, SC Gunite, SC Fiberglass. The Retail Price should be the last column.

- Potential option for manual designer cost adjustment down

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long Term - 
- Admin proposal large screen
    - Filters by designer
- Add logic and safeguards for no internet
- Fiberglass Shells
- Auto update without being public
- Admin Pricing Menu Cleanup
- Performance Data for Admin overhaul (coming soon)
- Role transfer logic
- Equipment logic for lights when selecting multiple can be cleaned up
- Add aux pump - double main drain run. every pump gets same drain run

- Potential column for "Included Items"
    - Base equipment, base options, etc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Needed - 
- Permitting and County associated costs tied to City / State field
- Templates
    - Remodel**
    - Commercial Pool Pricing
    - Sales Templates (when not in effect)
- Logic for stipulations / what specs require or omit what items
- Exposed Pool Wall
    - Has to allow for $8.50 of forming for every sqft of wall
    -plus facing
    - allow for increase of 33% concrete cost for sqft used
    - Facing option

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan of Action - 
- Beta test internally with a few designers for feedback & fixes
- Roadmap with wanted features with prioritization by importance

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Confusion -
- There is a $1250 kicker always present in retail cost (E309)
- Spa Prep ($250) never included in COST-NEW (INTD25)?
- 'Columns' only bill when a facing is selected; otherwise ignored (stone/rockwork)
    - Custom facing option?
- Remodel workflow
    - Cant find tabs in excel?

Question - 
- Should things like Cleaner & Autofil run be inputs when entered on equip? Or stay in plumb
- Should Water Features (costs) be grouped into Equip cost breakdown (like excel) or separate like the app now
- What other information can be included in the large Tile in proposal summary?
- What stages a Proposal can be in;
        - Currently; Draft, Submitted, *deleted*.
        - Possibly; In Progress, Saved for Later, Archived, Submitted, Approved, Completed.
- Proposal version needs to be included in the different breakdowns?
- Costs / Equipment that is 'included' by default?

 A couple changes to make in the Proposal Summary screen. 1st, the large summary tile information needs to change. The 2x4 table instead needs to have (column 1) 'Customer Name:', 'Job Location:'(this is the city), 'Build Type:' (this will only be 'New Pool' for all proposals for now), 'Last Modified:' (this will be the date of the last modification OF THAT VERSION, other versions might have a different date). Column 2 - 'Price Model:' (displays the price model pill box, instead of in the top right), ' We need to get rid of the 'Pre 1% COGS Breakdown' tile. Next, add the export checkbox to the Contract tile just like it is for the other tiles.
