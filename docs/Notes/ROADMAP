Short Term - 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mid Term - 
- $$ Logo upload option for admin, makes available for franchise

- Login passwords and role promotion / pass reset
    I want you to review the file i have made at /docs/Notes/Login Overhaul and before making any changes ensure you understand what needs to be done or ask any questions you may have. If I have left out anything that you think should be added bring that up too. Then i will tell you to implement this change

- Potential option for manual designer cost adjustment down
We need to include a backdoor way for a designer to manually adjust the retial price DOWN of a proposal. This will be done by using the Custom Features category - if a custom feature is added with a negative amount, subtract this amount from the total retail price. Be sure to include this as a line item in the cost breakdown for custom features cost as well. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long Term - 
- Admin proposal large screen
    - Filters by designer
- Add logic and safeguards for no internet
- Fiberglass Shells
- Auto update without being public
- Admin Pricing Menu Cleanup
- Performance Data for Admin overhaul (coming soon)
- Role transfer logic
- Equipment logic for lights when selecting multiple can be cleaned up
- Add aux pump - double main drain run. every pump gets same drain run
- Keyboard Nav dropdown selection trouble
- Homescreen background change

- Potential column for "Included Items"
    - Base equipment, base options, etc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Needed - 
- Permitting and County associated costs tied to City / State field
- Templates
    - Remodel**
    - Commercial Pool Pricing
    - Sales Templates (when not in effect)
- Logic for stipulations / what specs require or omit what items
- Exposed Pool Wall
    - Has to allow for $8.50 of forming for every sqft of wall
    -plus facing
    - allow for increase of 33% concrete cost for sqft used
    - Facing option

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan of Action - 
- Beta test internally with a few designers for feedback & fixes
- Roadmap with wanted features with prioritization by importance

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Confusion -
- There is a $1250 kicker always present in retail cost (E309)
- Spa Prep ($250) never included in COST-NEW (INTD25)?
- 'Columns' only bill when a facing is selected; otherwise ignored (stone/rockwork)
    - Custom facing option?
- Remodel workflow
    - Cant find tabs in excel?

Question - 
- Should things like Cleaner & Autofil run be inputs when entered on equip? Or stay in plumb
- Should Water Features (costs) be grouped into Equip cost breakdown (like excel) or separate like the app now
- What other information can be included in the large Tile in proposal summary?
- What stages a Proposal can be in;
        - Currently; Draft, Submitted, *deleted*.
        - Possibly; In Progress, Saved for Later, Archived, Submitted, Approved, Completed.
- Proposal version needs to be included in the different breakdowns?
- Costs / Equipment that is 'included' by default?

 A couple changes to make in the Proposal Summary screen. 1st, the large summary tile information needs to change. The 2x4 table instead needs to have (column 1) 'Customer Name:', 'Job Location:'(this is the city), 'Build Type:' (this will only be 'New Pool' for all proposals for now), 'Last Modified:' (this will be the date of the last modification OF THAT VERSION, other versions might have a different date). Column 2 - 'Price Model:' (displays the price model pill box, instead of in the top right), ' We need to get rid of the 'Pre 1% COGS Breakdown' tile. Next, add the export checkbox to the Contract tile just like it is for the other tiles.
